**LEVEL 13 -> LEVEL 14** 

Password: 8ZjyCRiBWFYkneahHwxCv3wb2a1ORpYL

Goal: The password for the next level is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can only be read by user bandit14. For this level, you donâ€™t get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level. Note: localhost is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on.

1. Check documentation for commands mentioned: 
    1. ssh: Logging into a remote machine.
    2. telnet: Interactive communication with another host using the TELNET protocol. 

2. Log in to bandit13
   1. Using command ls: One file called: sshkey.private 
   2. Changing directory to the one mentioned in the goal. 
   *Mistake*: Not a directory. 
   First using the command ls to see what's in the home directory. 
   Not of any use. 
   3. Finding /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and checking type of file. 
      1. *file /etc*: Directory
      2. *cd /etc*
      3. ls
      4. *find bandit_pass*: gives a list of several files.
      5. *file bandit_pass*: directory
      6. *cd bandit_pass*
      7. ls
      8. *file bandit14*: regular file, no read permission 
These steps are to be performed after logging into bandit14 
**Mistake**: Interpreted the question wrong. 
Login to bandit14: 
1. ls 
2. cat sshkey.private 
3. ssh -i sshkey.private bandit14@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 **Mistake** 
Reference: (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/Keys)

4. ssh -i sshkey.private bandit14@localhost
Successfully logged into bandit14. 
5. cd .. : to change directory to home directory
6. cd /etc/bandit_pass
7. cat bandit14
